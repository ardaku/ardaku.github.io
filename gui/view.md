# View
A view, canvas, scene or draw-area is a widget that renders 2D or 3D vector
graphics.  For most software, the view is the main part of the application; a
word processor shows the document, a web browser shows the webpage, 3D modeling
software show the model, and a video game shows the rendered world in the view.
