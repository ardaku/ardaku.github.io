# Quick-Menu
A quick-menu is a graphical overlay where you can search for menu actions by
name.  It is essentially the client-side version of Unity's HUD.  Instead of
burying your menu items in a [menu-bar](menubar.md), you can do a quick search
for what you want to do.  An important part of the quick-menu is that it also
shows you the keyboard shortcuts.  The recommended keyboard shortcut for the
quick menu is <kdb>Esc</kdb> for ease and accessibility.

The quick-menu may also implement advanced commands for power users.  The
commands may be executed in a similar manner to vim; Enter in a number followed
by a shortcut to repeat a command that many times.  The quick-menu may also
provide a programmable macro interface by typing "!".  <kdb>Esc</kdb> will exit
the quick-menu and return focus to the program.
