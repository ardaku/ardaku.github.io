A nav-bar, tab-bar on iOS, or bottom navigation on Android is a widget that
lets you select different [pages](page.md) or buttons through a small number of
fixed horizontal tabs.  A nav-bar should be limited to six tabs maximum.  The
tabs of a nav-bar may be the pages of the application, or pop-up pages that
provide additional buttons that did not fit in the [header-bar](headerbar.md),
or what would usually be found in a [tool-bar](toolbar.md) or
[menu-bar](menubar.md).

Nav-bars are most often located at the bottom of the window, although sometimes
at the top.  Top located nav-bars should be avoided because of to the
[criticism on header-bars](headerbar.md#criticism).
