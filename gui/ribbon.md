# âš  Ribbon
**Archaic**: Use [Nav-Bar](navbar.md), [Header-Bar](headerbar.md),
[Info-Pane](infopane.md), and [Quick-Menu](quickmenu.md) instead for modern
GUIs.

A ribbon is a tabbed [tool-bar](toolbar.md), mostly used in Microsoft Office.

## Criticism
Ribbons have the sames issues as [tool-bars](tool-bar.md#criticism), and often
take up more screen space.  Their location at the top of the screen often means
the working area is only the bottom half of the screen.  Their layout is usually
haphazard and suffers the same issues as [menu-bars](menu-bar.md).
