# âš  Title-Bar
**Archaic**: Use [header-bar](headerbar.md) instead for modern GUIs.

A title-bar is a widget that appears at the top of a window, that allows you
to drag the window around the screen (desktop-only).  The title-bar usually
contains the title of the window in the center, a close button on the right, and
sometimes the window icon on the left.  On some systems, the titlebar may also
contain the minimize and maximize buttons.

By definition, the titlebar is non-customizable by the application that it's
associated with (besides changing the title).  The look, feel and layout
customization is handled by the desktop environment, so the title-bar of all
windows looks the same.

## Criticism
Title-bars are generally considered space-inefficient, and do not integrate with
the application (1).

[Header-bars](headerbar.md) make your app more visually appealing than apps with
title-bars, which is a big reason why GNOME and MacOS tend to "look better" than
Windows and KDE.
