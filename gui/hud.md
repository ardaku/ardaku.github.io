# Hud
Hud (Head-Up-Display or Heads-Up-Display) is a graphical overlay that displays
some kind of status to the user.  The Hud has a transparent background as to not
distract from the immersion of the application or video game.  Unlike other
graphical overlay widgets, Hud stays on the window at all times.
