# Tab-Tree
A collapsable side-pane on the left side of a window for selecting tabs.  The
tabs may be grouped in a tree-style fashion.  The tab-tree can be implemented
as a [drawer](drawer.md) on smartphones.  Tab-trees should include a search bar
to easily find lost tabs.  Tab groups should be able to be closed and re-opened
once needed again.

The "hamburger" icon may be used to show/hide the tab-tree.  Also moving the
mouse to the left side of the screen may also open the tab-tree for quick
access, and leave the drawer to close it (if it was opened via mouse motion).
