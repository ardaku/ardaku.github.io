A panel or side-pane is a widget that displays information/properties of a
file or object.  It is usually located on the right side of the screen.  A panel
may or may not allow editing of these properties.  Panels are generally useful
for complicated tasks such as vector graphics creation and 3D modeling, where
there are lots of variables the user might want to tweak.  In some cases, the
panel can replace [tool-bars](toolbar.md), [menu-bars](menubar.md),
[pop-ups](popup.md) and even [hamburger-menus](hamburger-menu.md)!

For smartphone GUIs, there is not enough horizontal space for a panel, so they
should be implemented as a separate [page](page.md) or [drawer](drawer.md) that
lists each property, and when selected, previews the [viewer](viewer.md) while
the user tweaks the property.
