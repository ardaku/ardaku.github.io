# âš  Context Menu
**Archaic**: Use [Nav-Bar](navbar.md), [Header-Bar](headerbar.md),
[Panel](panel.md), and [Quick-Menu](quickmenu.md) instead for modern GUIs.

A context menu is a menu that provides menu options/buttons when the user uses
a secondary click (usually right click) or holds their finger down on a touch
screen.

## Criticism
Context menus cause issues because the action of right click, or long touch is
non-discoverable, and therefore requires training.  Secondly, long-touch input
should never be used because it's a time-sensitive input method, and there are
no other alternative input-methods for entering context menus on smartphones.
